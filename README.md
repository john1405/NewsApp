I used the API of NewsApi.org and the UI is very
user-friendly developed in FLUTTER.
    1:-  Users also see the news according to their
    2:- category
    3:- There are lots of categories of news.
    4:-  Users also see the photo in the post box
    

You can also check the API https://newsapi.org/  .
